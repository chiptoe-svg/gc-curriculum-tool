# GC Curriculum Tool

A curriculum-design and analysis tool for the Clemson University Department of Graphic Communications. It serves as the living record of the GC department's curriculum — what it is, what it is becoming, and how well it builds toward defined career destinations.

Two questions drive everything:

> **Q1.** How well does the GC curriculum build students toward the careers we claim to prepare them for?
>
> **Q2.** For any individual course, do the prerequisites students walk in with actually support what the course expects?

> 📰 **[Executive brief →](https://chiptoe-svg.github.io/gc-curriculum-tool/docs/executive-brief.html)** — three-minute orientation: what the tool does, why, and how it functions. Start here.
>
> 📖 **[Full vision →](https://chiptoe-svg.github.io/gc-curriculum-tool/docs/superpowers/vision/gc-curriculum-tool-vision.html)** — the two questions in full, the 3-Act program structure, the Problem-Solver pyramid, and illustrative end-state visualizations.

> 🧪 **[Open the live tool →](http://130.127.162.180:3000/)** — CourseCapture · Explore · Program, running locally on a Clemson LAN host (Basic Auth, reachable only from inside the Clemson network). For a quick orientation without LAN access, the [executive brief](https://chiptoe-svg.github.io/gc-curriculum-tool/docs/executive-brief.html) is the right starting point.

## Status

**Hybrid deploy shipped (Phase 2).** Same codebase, two runtime personalities. Faculty surfaces (`/capture`, `/explore`, `/program`, `/admin`, `/settings`) run on a local Mac on the Clemson LAN behind HTTP Basic Auth, using local omlx (Qwen3.6 family) for LLM calls and Docling for PDF extraction. Partner-facing surfaces (`/partners/*` magic-link survey, `/preview/*` legacy M-trial) run on Vercel against OpenAI. Same Neon Postgres backs both.

**CourseCapture v1 live.** Audit-conversation workflow at `/capture/<course-code>` that combines catalog values, Canvas imports, uploaded materials, linked Google Docs/Sheets/Slides + Drive PDFs, and voice/chat audit, then produces an immutable Course Outcome Profile snapshot. Faculty are actively running audits.

**Explore v1 live.** Prescriptive alignment + what-if scenarios at `/explore/<course-code>`: custom-target authoring, downstream-target auto-detection, and counterfactual comparisons.

**Program Coverage Matrix (Phase 1A) live.** `/program` renders snapshots × career-target sub-competencies as a depth-aware heat map with on-demand AI scoring.

**Industry Partner Input — Plans 1 + 3 shipped.** Magic-link survey for industry partners (CSV import, invites, draft/submit/delete flow) plus AI synthesis layer at `/admin/synthesis` that aggregates per-target themes, salary distributions, partner quotes, and proposed KUD edits. **[Pilot writeup →](https://chiptoe-svg.github.io/gc-curriculum-tool/docs/superpowers/pilot/2026-05-19-industry-partner-input-pilot.html)** Plan 2 (admin views + project ratings) still ahead.

**CourseCapture v2 Stage 1 (Foundation) shipped.** Append-only `capture_messages` log keyed by session, provider abstraction extended with `completeWithTools` across OpenAI / Anthropic / Local / Fake (Vercel AI SDK v6), and per-course `audit_mode` toggle. Stage 2 (Ingestion: per-material chunker + Weaviate-backed retrieval) waits on the local Weaviate instance.

## Stack

- **Next.js 15** (App Router, Turbopack, TypeScript strict)
- **Neon Postgres** via **Drizzle ORM**
- **Tailwind CSS** + **shadcn/ui** + **base-ui**
- **Vitest** for unit + integration tests
- **AI providers** (`lib/ai/provider.ts`): OpenAI / Anthropic / Local omlx / Fake — pick via env. Tool-using path via Vercel AI SDK v6 (`completeWithTools`).
- **Docling-serve** for PDF extraction on the local Mac (CPU mode); **unpdf** fallback on Vercel.
- **Weaviate** (planned, Stage 2) — multi-tenant hybrid retrieval over per-course materials.
- **launchd** manages the local Next.js + Docling-serve processes; restart on crash.
- **Vercel** hosts the partner / preview side.

## Repo origin

This repo was created from the design phase of a working session with Claude Code on 2026-05-17, before any code was written. The spec → plan → implementation workflow is captured in `docs/superpowers/`.
